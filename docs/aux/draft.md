1. Novelty Items - Whose value is mainly in their novelty. Trinkets etc.
2. Representative Place Holders - Items that are used to represent something. In the sense that their value is in the information that they provide
3. Information Localization - Information about an object should be available as close to the object as possible. Signboards next to zoo exhibits would be useless if they were in some other location far away from the exhibit.
