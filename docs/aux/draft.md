Project 1 - Road to Nowhere
=============================

### Augmented Reality Knickknacks

Introduction
------------

This is an application built with Unity and Vuforia Engine. Pointing your camera at the right cubes turns them into intractable augmented reality knickknacks.

1. The Merge Cube turns into a scene representing Cape Canaveral, Florida.

2. The Class Cube turns into a scene representing Mysore, a city in India, where there is a large zoo.

### Will things like this become popular in several years when AR eye-wear  becomes ubiquitous? And what kinds of small physical objects would benefit from being enhanced by AR?

I believe things like this will become popular. There are many advantages that the virtual objects boast of as opposed to physical objects.

1. Virtual Objects are easy to replicate. Every subsequent copy of a virtual object costs a very tiny fraction of what it costs to make the first one.

2. Virtual Objects can be updates and changed very easily. It's as simple as a software update. With smartphones people have become very used to such software patches delivered periodically. Although this has led to the unpleasant practice of companies launching unfinished software products on the promise that they will be completed in the future via patches and updates, it still has its benefits.

3. Virtual objects are not constrained to the laws of physics. It's easy to make fantastical objects that appear magical.

Slowly we are moving towards making virtual objects feel more and more natural and one day it is a certainty that they will completely replace physical trinkets.

As to the question of what kind of small physical objects would benefit from such an AR enhancement the following points should help. I believe that the items that would _truly_ benefit are of the following three kinds.

1. Novelty Items - Items whose value is mainly in their novelty. (Trinkets, Keychains, etc.) These are items which capture your attention for a short duration but aren't of much interest later. Their utility spikes at an instant and diminishes quickly. Such items can enhance both their magnitude of novelty and the duration of utility by getting enhanced by AR. A trinket that keeps changing captures your attention for a longer duration than a static one.

2. Representative Place Holders - Items that are used to represent something. In the sense that their value is in the information that they provide. Augmented Reality enhancement is really just information refinement. A static image can only provide a limited amount information compared to a dynamic one. Therefor any object which is used as an information source or a representation of some information, benefits from getting enhanced by AR.


3. Information Localization - Information about an object should be available as close to the object as possible. Consider signboards next to zoo exhibits that would become useless if they were put in some other location far away from the exhibit. Things can be enhanced by AR whereby all the related information pertaining to an object can be made visible very close to that object. Such objects would also benefit quite a bit from AR enhancement. Consider a drivers license being viewed through AR eye-wear of a police officer. He needn't have to enter that info into some database in some computer, but he'll see all the necessary info appear right next to the drivers license he is holding.

Thus the future holds a special place for AR enhanced objects, it is very encouraging to endeavors that make these a reality. We are on that path.
