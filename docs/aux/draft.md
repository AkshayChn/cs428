### Augmented Reality Knickknacks

Introduction
------------

This is an application built with Unity and Vuforia Engine. Pointing your camera at the right cubes turns them into intractable augmented reality knickknacks.

1. The Merge Cube turns into a scene representing Cape Canaveral, Florida.

2. The Class Cube turns into a scene representing Mysore, a city in India, where there is a large zoo.

Discussion
----------

### Will things like this become popular in several years when AR eye-wear  becomes ubiquitous? And what kinds of small physical objects would benefit from being enhanced by AR?

1. Novelty Items - Whose value is mainly in their novelty. Trinkets etc.
2. Representative Place Holders - Items that are used to represent something. In the sense that their value is in the information that they provide
3. Information Localization - Information about an object should be available as close to the object as possible. Signboards next to zoo exhibits would be useless if they were in some other location far away from the exhibit.
