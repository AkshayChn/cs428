Discussion: The different perspectives
--------------------------------------
### Internal mental view of the scene and all its parts

The Ames Room Illusion(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames_room>) as seen below is a famous example of how we perceive things.

Our perspective of the world is entirely dependent on the stimulus received by our senses. By changing the relative sizes of things, our brain comes up with interpretations of what it sees and selects the one which seems to be the most plausible. In the Ames Room Illusion, it is far more plausible according to our brain's visual processing that the human is tiny, rather than the room being distorted.

In my Dancing on the Ceiling Scene as the floor below us shifts when the room turns, we feel a loss of balance, even though we may be sitting safely on a chair in the real world. This is because our internal mental image of the world depends a lot on our vision. And when it shifts, we feel as though we are very strongly affected by it.

### Uses in the real world

1. _Therapy_: One very good use of this is in therapy, especially where we are using it to treat phobias. In my scene of spiders and insects, seeing them in various sizes has a stark impact on how we perceive them. Having various perspectives of the tings that we are afraid of helps us understand them better. And a better understanding helps in reducing fear.

2. _Emergency Rescue Training_: The crew on a ship must be well versed in how to behave if the ship is capsizing or sinking. The orientation of the ship may change and the floor is no longer below your feet. By practicing in environments like in the _Dancing on the ceiling_ scene, a crew may become more experienced with such scenarios, and potentially save lives.

3. _Land Use Planning_: With our growing need for resources, we are very haphazardly building and settling in places without forethought. The recent heavy rains in the city of Bangalore, India are indicative of this problem. News article [here](https://www.deccanherald.com/city/top-bengaluru-stories/heavy-rains-return-after-a-lull-flood-parts-of-north-bengaluru-1053250.html). The recently developed parts of the city have been built on places which serve as flood plains in times of very heavy rainfall once every decade or two. Problems such as this would have been easily mitigated had someone seen the relief features of the geography at a smaller scale, and immediately recognizing the low lying areas.

4. _Architectural Design_: When designing places of habitation it is very important to experience these places in their true scale. Small models do not do justice. Thus Virtual Reality can help in providing various perspectives at various scales.

5. _Animal Behavior Studies_: Animals, especially the small ones, exhibit peculiar behavior at times that only makes sense at their scale. Tiny insects can drown in the dew drops formed on leaves of plants. Mosquitoes seem to be fairly resistant to rain([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWyoy44oV3Q)). A warthog hides safely in an otherwise dangerously accessible hole([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atscgwWdX6Q)). Behavior such as these and many other counter intuitive ones can be better understood if we can experience the world in the same scale and perspective as them.
