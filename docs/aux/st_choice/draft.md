Shapelab VR
===========

[Shapelab VR](https://shapelabvr.com/) is a 3D sculpting application that helps you build 3D models intuitively. It is available on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/571890/Shapelab/). It is especially useful for making objects that aren't very geometric or polygonal, but rather boulbous and freeform.

Introduction
------------

While apps like Blender also allow one to sculpt like you would with clay, the keyboard and mouse workflow is no match to the intuitive feel of a virtual reality controller.
