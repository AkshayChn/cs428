Shapelab VR
===========

[Shapelab VR](https://shapelabvr.com/) is a 3D sculpting application that helps you build 3D models intuitively. It is available on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/571890/Shapelab/). It is especially useful for making objects that aren't very geometric or polygonal, but rather boulbous and freeform.

While apps like Blender also allow one to sculpt like you would with clay, the keyboard and mouse workflow is no match to the intuitive feel of a virtual reality controller.
