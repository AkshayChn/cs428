\Competing products: 

Adobe Medium: Very Expensive. Aimed at professionals. Voxel based modeling.

Gravity Sketch: Soon to be free. But more for polygonal models, vertices, . Not dough like. Subdivision Modeling.



Shapelab uses Dynamic Tessellation: It dynamically adds triangles beneath, as you sculpt free form. As you scultp the software creates the geometry behind it

Better definition than voxels. 

\Very simple to learn.

\You can dynamically change material as you are sculpting.


\You can change the lighting and background environment on the fly.

Symmetry grid.

Multiple objects added very recently.

\Tools need refining.

\Some materials override the painting, some of them don't.

\You can export the obj and you'll retain the model exactly as you had made it.
