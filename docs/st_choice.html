<p><a href="https://shapelabvr.com/">Shapelab VR</a> is a 3D sculpting application that helps you build 3D models intuitively. It is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/571890/Shapelab/">steam</a>. It is especially useful for making objects that arenâ€™t very geometric or polygonal, but rather boulbous and freeform.</p>

<p>While apps like Blender also allow one to sculpt like you would with clay, the keyboard and mouse workflow is no match to the intuitive feel of a virtual reality controller.</p>
