<p>Facebook Reality Labs presented a paper at SIGGRAPH ’20 titled ``Holographic Optics for Thin and Lightweight Virtual Reality". They introduced a prototype virtual reality eye-wear that is thin and light and looks like a pair of sunglasses.</p>

<p>Current VR headsets are cumbersome, large and borderline uncomfortable to wear. The invention of thin and light VR wear is essential to make VR easy to use and inviting to a larger audience.</p>

<p>They use a few state of the art technologies such as holographic displays and optical folding to achieve this size reduction. They have made significant progress and here I’d like to explore their work.</p>
